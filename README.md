## Problem Statement
**Background**: Retail investors often need more practical guidance on making short-term profits from Bitcoin than traditional investment assets. Bitcoin Financial Advisor services can address this need by extracting prediction signals from Reddit data and customizing recommendations to investors' dynamic needs.

- **Target Audience**: Enique focuses on individuals who may not have substantial savings but are eager to generate passive income to enjoy life's simple pleasures.
- **Market Insight**: Two-thirds of the population invests in the markets, yet navigating the financial landscape is daunting and time-consuming—even for industry professionals.
-**Challenges**: Outsourcing financial advice is costly and largely inaccessible to our target users. Additionally, playing the safe, conservative long game does not yield significant immediate-term profits, which is a primary concern for our audience.

**Solution**: Enique's business value begins by addressing these pain points.


## Business Value

 </p>
 
- Superior Autonomy: Enique’s capabilities surpass those of typical human investment advisors.
  - Human investment advisors provide financial guidance based on standardized strategies and second-hand research. They cannot customize or generate ad-hoc analyses upon request. Additionally, their fee structures often must be revised for individuals with smaller deposits.
- Customized Strategies: Enique delivers specific investment strategies based on its proprietary market predictions.
Plug-and-Play Tool: Enique can seamlessly integrate any in-house proprietary prediction model, enhancing offerings for downstream clients.

**Illustrative Example:**

- Our team has developed a Bitcoin prediction model integrated as the default within Enique. More details on this feature will be provided later.

**Key Features:**

- Enique performs bespoke research on-the-fly, leveraging its computational power to address client queries immediately.
- Enique’s prediction models adapt in real time by directly integrating live data.
- Enique is available 24/7, with no fees, and is deposit size agnostic, making it accessible to all income levels.

These business values create earning opportunities, foster intellectual growth, and are cost-efficient in terms of money and time.

**Motto:**
- More earning and learning; less spending and tending.
