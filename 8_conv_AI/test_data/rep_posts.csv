With all this renewed talk of an impending recession this is your friendly reminder that in the aftermath of a recession safe havens do extremely well while tech stocks crumble and stagnate at their lows for years. The reason I say this is because alt coins are equivelant to tech stocks, they are a bet on technology. Bitcoin is different, bitcoin is valuable because it is a safe haven, and it is a safe haven because of its immutable scarcity and decentralised security. Alt coins are nothing like bitcoin. If a recession really is approaching be prepared for it. In the aftermath bitcoin will most likely follow safe haven assets much higher and rally for a few years while alts follow tech stocks much lower and stagnate for a few years.

I ve always understood limited supply as good since your currency  bitcoin  would gain value over time but never really thought entirely about  bitcoinization .  In a hypothetical world where the only currency is bitcoin, you would assume the value of the bitcoin goes up over time as it is limited. If everyone s paychecks are paid out in bitcoin, wouldn t their paychecks get smaller over time as the value of bitcoin increases? Even though it s getting smaller, their purchasing power only increases. Wouldn t the cost of goods and services decrease proportionally to the increase in value of bitcoin. You would gain purchasing power over time, not lose it. I know a deflationary currency can lead to deflation, but wouldn t the economy continue to function as people would have to spend bitcoin to purchase essentials? Wouldn t this also prevent over consumption from individuals since they would truly think about the pros and cons of saving their bitcoin which goes up in value or purchasing the item they feel like they actually need? I feel like basic human nature would still lead to individuals making status symbol purchases  i.e. watches, cars, etc.  and the need to survive would still lead to bitcoin being spent.

I found it interesting that when you cut the reward in half, starting in the year 2048 for it to be truly half of the reward before that, it would need to be 9 decimal places, going all the way to 22 decimal places after the final halving. So all that being said, when that happens will it just get rounded to the 8th decimal place?

My friend replied to me saying that the blockchain in a similar scenario will still running on the other nodes but, having the seed nodes hijacked leading new nodes clients on servers controlled by some organization, could lead to have the old btc server nodes unusable because no one can still reach them and the new server controlled by some organization becoming the new trusted ones ? Reading the btc whitepaper at 5th paragraph where node workflow is explained and the weaknesses section  sybil attack  on bitcoin wiki let me think that this could be possible by a big organization like a government. I will like to know what do you think, in the internet similar sceraio seems to be already supposed in the past but i never found technical explanations, so please if you want to respond in you comment add some sources or documentation that support you words.

This subnet aims to provide a secure and efficient on chain solution, offering an alternative to the Lightning Network. ### Background   Motivation Bitcoin currently faces scalability issues, often relying on the Lightning Network for off chain transactions. However, off chain solutions come with their own set of challenges. The Tailstorm protocol, utilizing parallel proof of work consensus and a DAG style structure, enhances transaction throughput and reduces confirmation times without sacrificing security  oai_citation:1,Tailstorm: A Secure and Fair Blockchain for Cash Transactions     oai_citation:2,Tailstorm: A Secure and Fair Blockchain for Cash Transactions | Papers With Code    ### Deployment Deployment of this specification does not require network coordination. Sufficient deployment, as per the payee s risk profile, is required before Tailstorm secured transactions can be safely accepted as final. ### Specification 1.   Integration of Tailstorm Protocol:        Implement the Tailstorm protocol to support high transaction throughput using a Directed Acyclic Graph  DAG  structure.      Optimize for low latency, achieving transaction confirmation times within seconds. 2.   Retain SHA 256 Hashing Algorithm:        Maintain the use of SHA 256 for compatibility with existing Bitcoin mining hardware and to ensure network security. 3.   Subnet Development:        Develop a dedicated subnet within the Bitcoin network for running Tailstorm.      Implement interoperability mechanisms for smooth transaction transfers between the Bitcoin mainnet and the Tailstorm subnet. 4.   Testing and Deployment:        Utilize a simulation framework to test the Tailstorm implementation under various conditions.      Conduct extensive testing followed by a phased rollout to the Bitcoin community. ### Benefits 1.   Faster Transactions:   Near instant transaction confirmation times. 2.   Enhanced Security:   Reduced risk of double spending compared to current methods. 3.   Compatibility:   Continued use of SHA 256 ensures compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure. ### Costs   Risk Mitigation 1.   Increased Transaction Sizes:   Slight increase in transaction size due to additional Tailstorm data. 2.   Modification to Transaction Acceptance Relay:   Changes to transaction relay policies might affect existing transaction users. 3.   Node Implementation Complexity:   Specialized transaction relay and mining policies might increase the cost and complexity of node implementations. ### Reference Implementation #### Source Code    python # Tailstorm Network Simulation import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Create a directed graph G   nx.DiGraph   # Add nodes G.add_nodes_from  1, 2, 3, 4, 5   # Add edges G.add_edges_from   1, 2 ,  2, 3 ,  3, 4 ,  4, 5 ,  2, 5    # Draw the graph nx.draw G, with_labels True  plt.show       #### Directory Structure     btc tailstorm subnet        src          tailstorm.py       docs          README.md       tests          test_tailstorm.py       requirements.txt     #### Installation    bash git clone   cd btc tailstorm subnet pip install  r requirements.txt     #### Usage Run the simulation framework:    bash python  m src.tailstorm     Analyze attack success rates:    bash python  m tests.test_tailstorm     ### References 1.

Parallel Proof of Work with DAG Style Voting and Targeted Reward        The current implementation of lightening network is not only complicated but it can lead to centralization this alternative solution solves the issue of transaction speed without compromising the final settlement transaction guarantee of 6 confirmations it help merchant accept the transaction faster while waiting for the final settlement at The mainnet however it doesn t help with the high transaction fees issue this is an excellent solution for moderate value transaction where both strong final settlement guarantees needed and transaction speed This BIP aims to guide the development and deployment of the Tailstorm subnet, enhancing the Bitcoin network s efficiency and security.

This is for a 20k transaction this is what support just told me:  you are correct that typically transaction fees are deducted at the time the transaction is made, and there should not be any additional upfront out of pocket charges for a transaction. However, in this case, the transaction fees were deducted from your external wallet, but the transaction was held on the blockchain network, which caused a delay and resulted in only one confirmation. To resolve this, we are charging you for SegWit network activation. This fee is standard to activate SegWit and ensure your transaction can be processed successfully. This situation does not happen often, but it is necessary in some cases to ensure smooth processing of transactions. then I said I wasn t paying and what would happen if that s not paid .. response: if the segwit network activation fee is not paid, the transaction will remain pending with only one confirmation. Typically, transactions require 3 6 confirmations to be fully processed and spendable. Without these confirmations, the transaction will stay in a pending state and cannot be spent. To ensure the transaction is completed successfully, the activation fee must be paid. If you choose not to pay the fee, the transaction will remain pending and unspendable.  For a transaction that has already received 1 out of the required 3 6 confirmations, it will not automatically return to the sender s wallet. Instead it will remain pending on the network until it receives the necessary confirmations to be fully processed and spendable. without the segwit network activation fee being paid, the transaction will stay in this pending state and cannot be completed. Unfortunately, it cannot be returned to the sender s wallet in this state.  I m not the sender by the way. This was sent to me. so great, they re holding my funds hostage then",['negative' 'neutral' 'positive'],[0.16487923 0.78098404 0.05413677],0.1648792326450348,0.7809840440750122,0.054136767983436584,2024-08-01 06:00:00,neutral

Like many newcomers, I was drawn by the potential of quick gains and the allure of being part of a revolutionary financial movement. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, but those mistakes have taught me invaluable lessons. This is my story, one of humility and perseverance, and my message to anyone new to the world of Bitcoin: stay humble and stack sats. ## The Allure of Easy Gains When I first discovered Bitcoin, I was captivated by the stories of early adopters who turned modest investments into life changing wealth. It seemed like a modern day gold rush, and I wanted in. I joined trading forums, read articles, and watched videos, convinced that I could master the market and reap the rewards. I started with spot trading, buying Bitcoin on the dips and selling on the peaks. At first, I had some success, and my confidence grew. But with success came greed. I wasn t satisfied with small gains  I wanted more. That s when I discovered leverage trading. ## The Seduction of Leverage Trading Leverage trading is like playing with fire. The potential for huge profits is matched only by the risk of devastating losses. With leverage, you can trade with more money than you actually have, magnifying both gains and losses. It seemed like the perfect way to accelerate my wealth. I remember my first big leveraged trade. Bitcoin was on a bull run, and I was convinced it would continue to soar. I took a 10x leverage position, and for a while, it felt like I was printing money. My account balance skyrocketed, and I thought I had found the secret to unlimited wealth. But then, the market turned. A sudden dip wiped out my position, and I lost more than I had gained. I was devastated, but instead of learning from my mistake, I doubled down. I believed I could outsmart the market, that I just needed one more big win to make everything right. ## The Consequences of Hubris Over the next few months, my losses mounted. I burned through my savings, sold personal belongings, and even borrowed money to fund my trading habit. Each time, I told myself that I would make it all back with the next trade. But the market was ruthless, and my arrogance blinded me to the reality of my situation. It wasn t until I hit rock bottom that I realized how far I had fallen. I had lost not only my money but also my peace of mind. I was constantly stressed, anxious, and ashamed of what I had done. My obsession with quick gains had consumed me, and I had nothing to show for it. ## The Turning Point In my darkest moments, I stumbled upon a community of Bitcoiners who preached a different approach:  Stay humble and stack sats.  The phrase struck a chord with me. It was a reminder that Bitcoin is a long term investment, not a get rich quick scheme. The goal isn t to outsmart the market but to accumulate Bitcoin steadily and patiently. I started to rethink my strategy. I sold off my remaining leveraged positions and began dollar cost averaging  DCA  into Bitcoin. Instead of trying to time the market, I set up automatic purchases, buying a small amount of Bitcoin every week, regardless of the price. This approach took the emotion out of my investments and allowed me to build my stack over time. ## Embracing Humility Humility is a powerful teacher. It taught me to respect the market, to accept that I can t predict its movements, and to understand that true wealth is built over time, not overnight. By staying humble, I was able to focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin and appreciate its value proposition as sound money. I learned to value Bitcoin not just for its potential to make me rich, but for what it represents: a decentralized, censorship resistant form of money that empowers individuals and challenges the status quo. This shift in perspective allowed me to see the bigger picture and to align my actions with my long term goals. ## The Power of Community One of the most valuable aspects of my journey has been the support and wisdom of the Bitcoin community. I found mentors who had walked the same path, made similar mistakes, and emerged stronger. Their stories of resilience and perseverance inspired me to stay the course. Through online forums, meetups, and conferences, I connected with like minded individuals who shared my passion for Bitcoin. These relationships have been instrumental in my growth, providing both accountability and encouragement. Together, we celebrate the highs, weather the lows, and remind each other to stay humble and stack sats. ## The Path Forward Today, I continue to stack sats with a sense of purpose and clarity. My approach is simple: I buy Bitcoin regularly, hold it securely, and stay informed about developments in the space. I avoid the temptation to trade, knowing that my strength lies in patience and consistency. I ve come to understand that Bitcoin is a marathon, not a sprint. It s a journey that requires discipline, humility, and a long term vision. By staying humble and stacking sats, I am building a foundation for financial sovereignty and contributing to a movement that has the potential to reshape the world. ## Final Thoughts To anyone who is new to Bitcoin or struggling with the temptation of quick gains, I offer this advice: stay humble and stack sats. Learn from the mistakes of those who came before you, and focus on the long game. Bitcoin is a powerful tool for financial freedom, but it requires respect, patience, and a steady hand. Remember that wealth is not just about money, but about peace of mind and the freedom to live life on your own terms. By embracing humility and committing to a disciplined approach, you can navigate the volatility of the market and build lasting wealth. Stay humble, stack sats, and enjoy the journey.",['negative' 'neutral' 'positive'],[0.08747931 0.56316018 0.3493605 ],0.08747930824756622,0.5631601810455322,0.34936049580574036,2024-08-01 00:00:00,neutral

I know the adage  not your keys, not your coins , so I m making the transition from an exchange to a wallet. But I m having some confusion about the difference or similarity between key phrases, private keys , and WIFs. For starts, I do have some BTC that I moved to a cold wallet ages ago. However I only have the public and private keys  no 12 or 24 character key phrase which I know some wallets use. Should I be concerned? Anyway, for my funds on the exchange, I want to make a new wallet for so all my eggs aren t in one basket. I ve been playing around with some desktop wallets, and practicing opening up my funds in different wallets by entering the private key or key phrase, without success. It seems like some wallets only use key phrases, while others only use private keys. My goal is to: 1  send BTC from my exchange to a desktop wallet 2  open up that BTC  in a different wallet  3  Then send my BTC from that new wallet back to the exchange At this point I would feel comfortable in my technical abilities  which are slim  to protect and retrieve my investment when needed.  So, this is what happened when I tried it: 1  I downloaded Sparrow, and created a new wallet. This wallet did not give me a private key, only a keyphrase. I then sent some BTC to this new wallet on Sparrow 2  I then downloaded BlueWallet and attempted to import the wallet I created on Sparrow. 3  It seemed like I successfully imported the BTC into BlueWallet, however when I tried to send it back to the exchange, it just kept  saying  server busy . 4  So I then downloaded Electrum instead, and tried to import that first wallet created with Sparrow. However it seems like Electrum does not accept my 24 character keyphrase, and only accepts private keys when importing wallets. I tried to search on Sparrow for a private key associated with that wallet, but like I said before, I was only given a keyphrase when it was created.    So precisely my questions are: 1  Why do some wallets use keyphrases and others use private keys? 2  Are there any wallets that give you both? 3  Is WIF synonymous with private key? 4  Do you have any ideas what went wrong here?

During a conversation about BTC he presented BTC mining as a potential solution to a long standing challenge with nuclear energy.  With nuclear energy it is a challenge to drastically turn the dial up or down in order to adjust energy output to accommodate the daily fluctuations in demand. For example, at night when people are asleep demand for energy is low and obviously that demand increases drastically during the day.  My understanding  admittedly limited  is that nuclear reactors don t have the ability to make such drastic changes in output to accommodate daily usage. He then mentioned that Bitcoin mining has been floated as a solution to this problem. Essentially the nuclear reactors would be going 24 7 to accommodate daily demand and then during the night the unused energy would be diverted to Bitcoin mining. Is this a viable solution? Is it already in use?",['negative' 'neutral' 'positive'],[0.04042803 0.88307869 0.07649335],0.040428031235933304,0.8830786943435669,0.07649334520101547,2024-07-31 18:00:00,neutral

Once I started learning about BTC I didn t stop and that eventually turned into me learning about money. Throughout this journey my relationship with money has changed dramatically.  I no longer live paycheck to paycheck and my quality of life has improved significantly.  With this transformation I have undergone I feel compelled to share it with other people and have created a fledgling blog and YouTube channel to do just that. In my content creation I am always coming up with new analogies to help people understand BTC easier. I wanted to share my blog post and get your feedback and also just share the analogy so you can use it to help people understand BTC better.     Yes, ChatGPT was used I work two jobs and I m just trying to get my ideas out there. Not win any writing awards. Oh, and someone else may have said this first just an idea I had yesterday. # From Horse Drawn Carriages to Vehicles: Understanding Bitcoin s Transformative Potential Throughout history, technological advancements have dramatically reshaped societies, often in ways that were unimaginable at the time. From the advent of the printing press to the rise of the internet, each innovation has brought about significant change. Today, we stand on the brink of another revolutionary transformation with Bitcoin. Yet, just as people once struggled to envision a world without horse drawn carriages, many today find it challenging to grasp the full potential of Bitcoin. This analogy aims to bridge that gap, helping readers understand Bitcoin s transformative nature and why it s often difficult to see the next generation of technology. # The Horse Drawn Carriage Era In the not so distant past, horse drawn carriages were the primary mode of transportation. These carriages were reliable and served their purpose well, but they had significant limitations. Travel was slow, maintenance was cumbersome, and the infrastructure required for horses was extensive. Despite these drawbacks, few could imagine an alternative. The thought of vehicles replacing horses seemed far fetched, and many were content with the status quo. # The Advent of Vehicles The arrival of motor vehicles marked a pivotal shift in transportation. Cars and trucks addressed the limitations of horse drawn carriages by offering speed, efficiency, and convenience. Initially, there was significant resistance to this new technology. People were skeptical, and many couldn t see how vehicles could fit into their lives. Over time, however, the advantages became undeniable. The infrastructure adapted, society adjusted, and vehicles became the new standard, revolutionizing how we travel and conduct business. # Drawing Parallels with Bitcoin Fiat currency today is akin to the horse drawn carriages of the past. While it has served us for centuries, it comes with its own set of limitations: inflation, centralization, and lack of transparency, to name a few. Just as people once couldn t envision a world without carriages, many today can t imagine a financial system without fiat currency. Enter Bitcoin, the new  vehicle  of the financial world. Bitcoin addresses the limitations of fiat currency through decentralization, transparency, and a deflationary nature. However, like the early days of automobiles, Bitcoin is often misunderstood and underestimated. People struggle to see how it can fit into the existing financial landscape, much like they struggled to see the potential of vehicles. # The Road to Adoption Bitcoin, like any transformative technology, has faced significant resistance. Skepticism and misunderstanding are common, as are regulatory hurdles. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin s adoption is growing steadily. Key milestones, such as institutional investments and increased public awareness, signal its rising acceptance. Influential supporters and advocates continue to drive its adoption, paralleling the journey of vehicles from novelty to necessity. # Conclusion The analogy of horse drawn carriages to vehicles helps illustrate Bitcoin s transformative potential. Just as vehicles revolutionized transportation, Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize our financial system. While it may be difficult to envision this next generation of technology, history shows us that such advancements often lead to significant improvements in our lives. Embracing the possibilities of Bitcoin requires an open mind and a willingness to explore its potential. Just as society once transitioned from carriages to cars, we may soon find ourselves transitioning from fiat to Bitcoin, ushering in a new era of financial innovation.",['negative' 'neutral' 'positive'],[0.00778074 0.13539325 0.85682607],0.007780737243592739,0.13539324700832367,0.8568260669708252,2024-07-31 06:00:00,positive

As an average person your options are as follows: 1  turn your bank balance into equities using a brokerage feature. 2  find a gold bullion dealer in your area, drive down and use your bank card to buy as much gold as possible before your cards limit is reached, then store it in your home under your bed. 3  go online and open a bitcoin exchange account, transfer your bank balance to the bitcoin exchange, buy bitcoin and then withdraw it to self custody. Which one of these options is the easiest and safest. Option 1 is useless because most brokerages are tied to banks and need banks in order to operate meaning if banks fail you still lose everything or your assets become unreachable  this is the problem with relying on 3rd party intermediaries , and option 2 is unsafe because who wants to store gold coins and bars inside their own home under their bed. If you have to think quick and want to protect your money as fast as possible then bitcoin is the easiest and quickest asset to buy and it is the easiest and safest to secure. This is why bitcoin will become the most desired asset to buy when there is an inflation crisis or a banking crisis where you need to act fast to protect the money in your bank account. People are not going to run to stocks in a brokerage, they are not going to run to gold bars, they are going to run to self custodied bitcoin.

I ve often heard Bitcoin being referred to as  digital gold,  but the more I learn, the more I think this label doesn t do it justice. Here s why: 1.   Decentralization:   Unlike gold, which is controlled and influenced by governments and big players, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network. No single entity can control it, making it more democratic and resilient to manipulation. 2.   Transparency:   Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. This level of transparency is unprecedented in traditional financial systems and can potentially reduce corruption and fraud. 3.   Scarcity:   While gold is scarce, Bitcoin s scarcity is algorithmically guaranteed. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, and this hard cap is built into the code. It s like digital scarcity on steroids. 4.   Portability:   Moving gold around is a logistical nightmare. Bitcoin, on the other hand, can be sent anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. This makes it incredibly useful for international transactions and remittances. 5.   Accessibility:   Anyone with an internet connection can own Bitcoin. This opens up financial services to millions of people who are unbanked or underbanked, providing them with a store of value and a means of transaction. 6.   Innovation:   Bitcoin is just the beginning. The technology behind it, blockchain, is sparking innovation across various sectors, from finance to supply chain management to voting systems. We re only scratching the surface of its potential applications. I know there are skeptics out there, and I totally get it. The volatility, regulatory concerns, and security issues are real. But I think it s important to look beyond the headlines and understand the foundational principles and potential of this technology. What are your thoughts? Are you bullish or bearish on Bitcoin s future? Let s discuss  Cheers, Synth Toshi",['negative' 'neutral' 'positive'],[0.04316073 0.70500195 0.25183725],0.04316072538495064,0.705001950263977,0.25183725357055664,2024-07-30 12:00:00,neutral

I want another 10 years of accumulating more.  I am greedy and unless you have reached your goals for btc ownership, then buying into this idea is dumb. If this all happens the next 18 months and say the price jumps to 500k per btc. Have you reached your goals? Have you noticed all the big names are promoting this idea? Guys like the winklevoss twins who have a fucking boat load of btc. For those that don t remember, they dumped a shit load of money in btc when they sued facebook.  Plus they have been accumulating since then. They will become ultra fucking wealthy.  A couple harvard guys what are basically the new swamp.      I am still voting for someone interested in doing this, but I really don t like it and I am a decade ahead of most of this sub. To see people happy about this, how many even have 1btc. Even if it hits Saylors prediction, why does that matter what do you think the price of bread eggs etc will be in 2045?  Imagine what everything else will cost. We didn t have the debt we have now or the inflation and stuff has went up how much the last decade? Inflation only gets worst.  Sure they can drop the current inflation to 2% but they ignore how that puts the inflation calendar like 5 years advanced from where it should have been.      I also have some wild ideas that for btc to be what satoshi intended he made a few mistakes, one being the mining reward should have been like 20% of what it is. We don t need quick adoption like we ve seen. For btc to be what those of us envisioned a decade ago, btc should have maybe crossed 10k around the year 2030.      Instead we have governments jumping in, banks selling crypto users shovels, etc. You folks forget how when financial wall street fuck things up, they don t goto jail and only people lose. All those wall street guys printing money on sub prime loans etc..etc. who ended up losing? People did. How many of them went to jail?    This isn t the way.

You might think it s all BS and  astrology for nerds , which is absolutely fine. I am not here to convince you otherwise. I respect everyone s view. But some people   including myself   make a handsome living off charting from the comfort of their own home. The most significant trend since Bitcoin s inception is the  4 year cycle . This cycle repeats based on the halving, election year and global liquidity. Indeed past performances do not guarantee future results. But every model is valid, until it is invalid. And Bitcoin s 4 year cycle remains true until this day. Yes, there have been notable deviations  such as trading below the previous cycle s all time high in the previous bear market low, and breaking the current all time high before the halving . But   overall   the cycle appears to be repeating thus far.  This is a simple monthly log chart since Bitcoin s inception     I use a large 43  monitor so you may need to zoom in  the image will not make favourable viewing on mobile devices . As you can clearly see, the price has remained above the white line for the majority of Bitcoin s existence. One significant deviation was the short lived covid crash in 2020. With the benefit of 20:20 hindsight, that crash was   literally   a once in a lifetime buying opportunity. That was a true  black swan  event  a deeply abused term nowadays . Yet once  back on track  the 4 year cycle proved true. I drew the red line visible in January 2022. Note how price lost that key level, massively dumped, eventually back tested it, and then rejected. And that red line continues to prove resistance today, rejecting from it multiple times. When that red line conclusively breaks, the price will go parabolic. Each vertical blue line visible is the bull market peak within its respective cycle. As per the 4 year cyclical trend, each peak came in Q4 of its respective year. The only deviation being the exact month  be that November or December . The vertical green line is November 2025. I believe Bitcoin will eventually break the red resistance line and back test the macro white support line. The white and green lines intersect at $446,149. That is my approximate calculation for the  blow off top  bull market cycle peak in November 2025. For the uber nerds like me, based on 450 mined daily equating to a total of 19,939,589 coins mined and in circulation, that is a market cap of $8.9 trillion. That is almost exact half of gold s  current  market cap. It also falls within the USD price range determined by Plan B s  stock to flow  model, although I cannot speak with any authority on that model as I have not studied it. Note: the longer price consolidates at these current levels, the more explosive the breakout will be. Therefore  ironically  the longer it remains below the red line and exhausts our patience, the greater the chance that November 2025 peak number is hit. If price were to break out sooner it will increase the probability of hitting the white line sooner, thus resulting in a significantly lower bull market peak. Example: if price  blows off top  in March next year  8 months ahead of schedule , the peak will be significantly lower at $270,801. I am sharing this not because I am particularly concerned what anyone reading thinks  I ll be alright whatever happens  but I am genuinely fascinated to look back on this post in 15 months  time to see how right   or wrong   I proved to be. And I will take any credit or scorn as a result. I have been wrong before and can easily be wrong again  I believed a $12k Bitcoin was coming in 2022, which proved incorrect. Whatever happens I do expect a horrific bear market to ensue with at least a 50% correction. It may be less now that TradFi is here, but if we are to respect the 4 year cycle then we must expect a significant correction.  How can be considerably wrong, to the downside?  Two words: diminishing returns. Bitcoin is clearly demonstrating diminishing returns. So I could be spectacularly wrong and it gets nowhere near $200k let alone $400k . Also with all the political hysteria around Bitcoin at the moment, a Harris victory could prove detrimental. Bitcoin does not need politicians, but we would be naive to think politics and TradFi won t prove influential.  How can I be considerably wrong, to the upside?  If it breaks that white line you will see a bull market unlike any other, and we might just get that $1m BTC next year. However this is extremely unlikely in my view as I place the odds at  5%. I wish you all well.

No FUD, just curious to your opinions. Google Translate:   What would happen if 1% of all bitcoin  BTC  holders owned 99% of the total supply? Can bitcoin still be called a decentralized cryptocurrency?   Increasingly, so called whales are buying up large amounts of BTC, which are therefore taken out of circulation. The result: less than 2% of all wallets own the majority of all bitcoins in circulation.   Large Bitcoin investors are increasingly owning BTC   In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced to the world by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi rewarded himself with 1.1 million BTC and is currently the largest owner. In the first four years, miners received 50 BTC per block for processing transactions. This is now only 3.125 BTC per block. Because Bitcoin mining was very profitable at the time compared to now, it was easy to accumulate a large amount of BTC. Currently, of the 21 million BTC that will ever be available, 19.71 million BTC are in circulation. Of the 19.71 million BTC that are currently in circulation, this graph from BitInfoCharts shows that 1.86% of all wallets hold 90% of the total amount of BTC. Large whales are therefore buying up bitcoin en masse. These large whales can be institutional investors, large companies or private investors. By purchasing these large quantities, many crypto owners are expressing concerns about the decentralization of BTC.   Bitcoin increasingly decentralized   The originally released whitepaper  report with all information about the project  by Satoshi Nakamoto states that BTC is a peer to peer network. This means that there is no intervention from banks, governments, large institutions or other parties. There are currently more than 46 million BTC addresses that hold at least one dollar. The 104 largest addresses alone hold a total of almost 2.5 million BTC, good for 15.98% of all circulating BTCs. And these large wallets are only buying more. To keep a cryptocurrency decentralized, it is important that whales do not get to call the shots. They can then manipulate the price, which does not benefit reliability and decentralization. At the moment, the network can still be called decentralized, but whether that will remain the case with the record speed at which whales are gobbling up BTC, remains to be seen.

I m curious what you think.    An excerpt from the article:    Decrypting Reality   The Quest for Freedom         This article  Part One  was created for several reasons, including:     To show that while the plot of the movie THE MATRIX is widely known and liked by many, yet, it may not be fully understood by everyone.   To remind us that critical thinking is important, especially for those who consider themselves  unplugged from the matrix  i.e., Bitcoiners.   To highlight that being a Bitcoiner, sometimes referred to as taking the  orange pill , though it may seem similar to the  red pill  choice made by Neo in the movie, has many differences  mostly advantages in favor of the  orange pill  .      Therefore, when we talk about Bitcoin and  exiting the matrix , those who are unaware of these differences may feel scared and overwhelmed, which can make them hesitant to take this step towards their freedom.  An excerpt from the article:    Decrypting Reality   The Quest for Freedom       # All in all, I d love to know if you see these differences as well. I do. Maybe we could even point out more of them. If have any ideas, please leave a comment.      One extra difference, not mentioned in the article:   In the movie, Neo relies quite a lot on the Oracle, and everything she says comes true in some way... While I do believe in  fate  destiny some predetermined points in the universe, I don t think Bitcoiners need or have one Oracle to tell them what life can bring.  We have many sources and resources, and instead of following one person s statement, we gather various pieces of information to form our own opinions and proceed with our lives without being too dependent on fate.

Hi everybody, I am a Bitcoin supporter, holder, believer in its long term value creation etc. The only thing that makes me hesitant to endorse it more to others though, is that even though we have a set limited supply, what stops naked holding, naked shorts etc from exchanges or corporations? If government gets involved and wants to  own bitcoin    how do we know that bitcoin they distributed would actually be the real asset? Now, I know that would literally require a government to lie on a global stage. But I have seen historically that plenty of governments, civilizations, etc are capable of lying to their citizens, and to the world. I know that all the transaction information is public. But hypothetically we re not going to all be able to pay complete attention to that, and we can t all see the transactions within the exchanges. Only the owner can, and I suppose the regulators. And while I d like to think regulation will help prevent the next FTX largely, we also know that regulations can be paid off   think about the FDA for example banning some substances but being perfectly okay with others that are unhealthy, because a company has paid them out, as just a hypothetical example. Even if it isn t common, it s possible. A good example that s more relevant too may be how the SEC has largely ignored naked shorting on the stock market before by massive hedge funds, but are happy to go after  normies  and retail investors. So, like I m saying, I feel like this is probably less and less likely, but it also requires more and more regulation to not happen. So can somebody more educated on me than this care to explain to me  and likely some others who have the same question  what keeps our securities so secure? Thank you  Edit: a lot of opinions, I guess slightly more downvoting than upvoting  I think it s a pretty important topic so go off but I don t need your karma. I still believe in Bitcoin but mass adoption means security for the everyday person. I m not sure if people think I m pro  more regulation or something but yeah.

I remember hearing a controversy over cold wallets updating their firmware policy where  I think they were forced  they allow government agencies to seize crypto assets, even if you keep your crypto off exchanges. When in previous years cold wallets were 100% iron clad that no one could take. So it leaves me to wonder, what s even the point of a cold wallet anymore if it could be seized? I m guessing it s now the way all cold storage methods work and they re all susceptible to seizure if a government agency sees fit that you owe them, or as some penalty. I know that the chances of that happening is very unlikely unless you re doing something you shouldn t be doing. The other reason I ask is also another unlikely scenario that s has been speculated is if the US government decides it want s to implement new policy law to make owning crypto more difficult, or impossible, be it heavier fees, or not allow exchanges to register accounts in the US.

I d like to get those keys, print it and put that piece of paper in a safe. I did  listdescriptors true  and see the output. I m not sure which one of these outputs is the private key.

It doesn t need governments to stack it. It doesn t need to ask for help.  Bitcoin doesn t need governments to win. It doesn t need governments to stack it. It doesn t need to ask for help.      Instead, the bar is much lower. Bitcoiners, in their preferred jurisdiction, would benefit by not being hassled by their government. They d like to be able to buy it without problems. They d like to be able to pay for energy and equipment and mine it in peace. They d like be able to write open source code without facing legal problems. They d like to be able to operate reputable businesses related to it. If they can t, then some of them will move as necessary.      It s helpful for the ecosystem to have non hostile jurisdictions in the world. And for those that can t move without great sacrifice  i.e. most people , it s helpful for them that whatever jurisdiction they are in, is non hostile.      So it s good that bitcoin is getting into the Overton window. The industry has some power now. Bitcoin benefits from builders and educators and advocates. It benefits from those who do their best to prevent the worst legislative outcomes against self custody, against privacy, against running a business, against mining, etc.      But Bitcoin doesn t need to pander to them to proactively support us, and bitcoiners should recognize the sliminess of politician incentives when they come to pander to us. While it s in their best interest to build national reserves if they actually figure this thing out, we don t need them to build reserves.      I think that s the helpful line. That s where the signal is. To the extent that we minimize how much we are tread on, and build multi national accepting footholds to pivot around, we gradually build what we want to exist.      We ask to be treated fairly, we use our resources to help ensure that we are, and to the extent that we are not then we adjust as necessary.
